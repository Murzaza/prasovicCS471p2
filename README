Programming Assignment

Building:
	sender:
		cd sender/
		make
	receiver:
		cd receiver/
		make

Running:
	sender:
		./sender <IP Address (Dotted Quad)> <Port No> <Chunk Size < 512> <Window Size>
	receiver:
		./receiver <Port No> [<Fail Rate>]
			-Fail Rate is an int from 0 to 100

Limitations:
	-When Sender times out and exits, receiver will just sit there waiting for input.
	-I can't get sender to get the ack packets from receiver on multilab, but it works
	 fine on my two home machines (Mac OS X 10.6.8, Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS), and a friend's
	 machine (Ubuntu Linux 11.04). I would recommend running both a personal computer and
	 not multilab.
	 	-Commands ran:
			./receiver 9900 20
			./sender 127.0.0.1 9900 511 4
